            <h1>CS267 Homework 0</h1>
            <br>
            <p>I'm a 3rd year undergraduate studying Electrical Engineering and
            Computer Science. I'm doing research at RISELab with Professor
            Anthony Joseph in distributed systems. I'm particularly interested
            in systems that make machine learning and managing large amounts of
            data more efficient, and I find applications of this within
            Internet of Things-related problems especially fascinating. I'd
            like to understand current techniques of parallelizing large
            workloads, their architectural implications, and future research
            directions.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Graph processing is an interesting application space for
            parallel computing, especially due to the ever-increasing size of
            graphs and the range of possible queries on those graphs. Scaling
            graphs to billions of edges requires distributing the graph across
            several machines, but querying a graph spread across commodity machines is
            much slower. Graphs used in production systems today model data
            that typically changes very rapidly, and while real-time analytics
            on such data would provide unique insights, it requires
            parallelization to do efficiently at scale.</p>
            <br>
            <p>One interesting paper on this issue is "Time-Evolving Graph
            Processing at Scale". This paper describes a system that optimizes
            computations in graphs when the underlying graph is dynamic. As
            such, it operates on snapshots of a graph, or a view of the entire
            graph at a particular point in time. If the graph changes
            before a computation completes, the system determines whether continuing
            the computation would result in a reasonably correct answer, and
            thus either continues as is or restarts with a newer graph
            snapshot. The proposed system abstracts away a lot of the issues
            with respect to parallelism by building on top of Resilient
            Distributed Datasets (RDD's), the data abstraction provided by
            Apache Spark.</p>
            <br>
            <p>One advantage of this approach is that building on top of Apache
            Spark allows for easier scaling, since the Spark deployment could
            be scaled to use as many commodity machines as needed, without
            using a supercomputer. The system was successfully demonstrated on
            Twitter's follow graph, which has approximately 1.5 billion edges.
            Thus, such a system could allow for faster and more efficient
            computation on even more dynamic data such as building sensors and
            finance.</p>
